Artist,Lyrics,Song
Charlie Puth ,   There's a moment when you find out Who your true friends are The ones who don't go by everyone elses ways  And its important to realize who your One and true love is And to not look back on yesterday's  Don't be asking what this world needs now You need to ask what makes you come alive some how Cause you do you better than anyone here So mark this as your year  Tomorrow I'm going on that train And I'm gonna pretend that it doesn't stop Cause I'm taking all my fears an making them my destination Bottom all the way to the top Don't be asking what this world needs now I need to see what makes me come alive some how Cause I do me better than anyone here So mark this as my year  Don't be asking what this world needs now You need to ask what makes you come alive somehow Cause I do me better than anyone here this is my year I have no fear cause all my obstacle's are clear ,The Moment 
Charlie Puth ,   Its 10 p.m. and I am missing My seventh song for December second My minds gone blank I can not think clear About the lyrics for this God damn song here  How do people have the attention span To go and do this Two hours in this chair I might as well call it quits  It's 12 a.m. and I am so screwed Looking up at people falling on YouTube Getting so bored to the highest degree This much be so easy for Kenny G  How do people have the attention span To go and do this Two hours in this chair I might as well call it quits  Another sappy love song My listeners will be pissed I would seriously pay someone Right now to go and help me with this  Da da da da da da da This is the chorus line Da da da da da da da I guess no lyrics here sounds fine As long as I have a catchy melody And some nice chord changes So you won't see that I suck at writing lyrics  I suck At writing lyrics  How do people have enough Motivation to go and do this Feels like a day in this chair And I haven't written down shit Feel like I'm running out of ideas For all these pieces And every time I try to get done Procrastination increases  Da da da da da da da This is the chorus line Da da da da da da da I guess no lyrics here sounds fine As long as I have a catchy melody And some nice chord changes So you won't see that I suck at writing lyrics ,I Suck At Writing Lyrics

Charlie Puth ,"   Oh-oh Doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo doo  Doo doo doo doo  I'm sitting here alone again Waiting for you to come see me now As time passes by In the blink of an eye I know I'll get to see you somehow  You are sitting home another night Waiting for someone to hold you tight Time passes by So quick indeed This time you're slipping away from me  It's been a long, cold, hard winter It was a long, drawn-out spring I took no wrong when you saw nothing in me But our love was something nice to see  We were sitting alone on the beach Letting all the sand between our feet As time passes by Blink of an eye Amazing how things ain't what they used to be Ain't what they used to be...  It was the shortest summer The fall was so abrupt Thought you'd be happy with the way things were But I guess it wasn't enough  I am outside sitting, writing this song You could have guessed that all along Time passed me by So quick indeed And you're the thing that I'm missing  I wrote this song all last night Tried to make the lyrics fit just right But I'm stilling having trouble with this very last part But I know it'll come from my heart But I know it'll come from my heart...

Charlie Puth ,"   My baby left me yesterday, Packed her bags and went away, yeah. High heels on the carpet,  took my keys and craved her name into my car seat.  And that's the last one I let push me around, I've said it before but I mean it now, eh. Get me out this city, I just need to clear my mind.  We left this evening, give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston, grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, oh.  When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April, We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all, We'll have it all.  One shot, one shot for my sorrows, oh yeah. Power up the white noise, maybe I'll forget her deep into the morning. And right inside this yellow house,  I'm reading CD's on the couch, but it's better than being stranded, nothing but myself in a studio apartment.  We left this evening, give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston, grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, oh.  When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April, We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all, We'll have it all.  I don't think I'm sleeping tonight, Something 'bout my stomach doesn't feel right, What you left in my chest on the left side, Where your he.. nah, fuck it. Time to take a drive.  Night skies got me feeling like Bruce Wing, 'Cept all I got is a pocket of loose change. Head and heart got me thinking that I'm too strange. Well maybe I'm different.  Word to two chainz, two lanes, Drift grip the wood crane, Lookin' at the exit signs, but it's your name (damn). On some purple rain shit, feelin' like Prince, gotta go and change my name chiz, same shit, ain't it?  Yeah, I know I don't seem complacent, Got enough on my chest but my heart's still vacant. And I can't take it, My love is unreciprocated, I've been through enough without ever gettin' the payment. But it's harder to heal than it is to endure, There's only so much that the liquor can cure, And all that liquor that's poured gave you a head of a tornado of every memory that had you trippin' before.  All that Christian Dior denim, Louis Vuitton leather, led em a late night, safe flight and good weather. Ain't enough to make me feel better, Ain't enough to make me forget all those nights in early December.  I think I was dreamin', But now I know I ain't been sleepin'. And some of these days, these feelings stoppin' me from eating, The pit of my stomach is heavy. I guess that's how it feels when you start to forget me.  I apologize for not caring for myself, I've never known anything else than putting myself after everyone else, And that fucks me up, it's true. These late nights really are new, And there's so little I can do besides drive. Lay awake think about where you layin' tonight, And fantasize about us living life in paradise, In a warm place where we never really have to die, But life ain't kind, we can't live fantasy, I just need to hear that you're maintaining sanity Cuz it's more important to me that you're doing alright Than the fact that I'm not sleepin' tonight.
